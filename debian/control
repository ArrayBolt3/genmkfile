Description: Generic Makefile
 Makes packaging scripts simpler. No more need to manually maintain
 'make install' targets or distribution specific install files such as
 debian/pkg-name.install.
 .
 Files in etc/... in root source folder will be installed to /etc/..., files in
 usr/... will be installed to /usr/... and so forth. This should make renaming,
 moving files around, packaging, etc. very simple. Packaging of most packages
 can look very similar.
 .
 Provides common make targets such as 'make install'. Very extensible through
 file ./make-helper-overrides.bsh or
 folder ./make-helper-overrides.d. By using overrides, any make target can be
 easily extended using pre or post hooks or replaced.
 .
 Contains a minimal Makefile while the heavy lifting is done by a bash script
 make-helper.bsh.
